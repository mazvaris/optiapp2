Rules:  
Strictly implement logic code from the git link provided with exceptions such as stylistic changes: adding client/patient context to relevant titles/fields, integration with existing dashboard design  
Do not implement any table schema yet \- this will be done when I explicitly prompt you.  
Do not implement any link I define \- unless I explicitly prompt you.  
For table list view \- I will explicitly tell you which table to fetch records from.  
For the code you use from git \- only make necessary changes to integrate it with the dashboard.  
Where new fields are being appended to an existing form \- ensure the new fields are added to the validation schema.
